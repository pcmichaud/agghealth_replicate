# Replication Archive
Last update: October 2022

This archive allows to replicate results reported in 

Fonseca, R., F. Langot, P.-C. Michaud and T. Sopraseuth (forthcoming): "Understanding Cross-country Differences in Health Status and Expenditures: Health Prices Matter", *Journal of Political Economy*

Most of the code is produced in Python, with a few exceptions. The use of Notebooks allows to follow each of the steps taken. The estimation of the model requires multiprocessor capabilities.

The archive contains a number of folders. Here is a description of each folder:

* **build** : This folder allows to follow steps to create the data inputs. 
* **data_sources**: This folder contains all the raw data files used in the paper. 
* **estimation**: contains the code for estimation of the model. **extension_copay** and **extension_wage** contain estimation code for extensions reported in Appendix. 
* **figures** : Used to save figures appearing in the paper. 
* **model**: contains the source python code for the model. **model_copay** and **model_wage** contains source code for extensions. 
* **post** contains notebooks to produce post-estimation results in the paper. 
* **tables** contains all tables in the paper. 

We use the Anaconda distribution for Python code execution. 

Should you have questions on the execution of the code, please write to Pierre-Carl Michaud, at pierre-carl.michaud@hec.ca.
